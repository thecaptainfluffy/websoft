<a href="https://thecaptainfluffy.github.io/websoft/"><h2>S01</h2></a>
<p>I have used Git, Github and Markdown in the past. Tools I really like to use.
    However Github pages is new to me and most say amazing tool that github provides to us.
    I have created and is currently working on a website. I hope that I can continue to work on it
    in this course. I am using tools like React-JS and redux to develop it. It's a music exploration website tool. It works together with Facebook and Spotify
    I have been hobby creating website last 10 years, never created somethine serious since in the past
    I have not really been structured. However after 3 years at this school I have started to developt the
    most serious project so far. Where everything is up and running on gitlab.
    I have seen Markdown before and I'm trying to add it more to all my projects. More projects I read online, the more I see the importance of documentations.
    Today I learned:
    Git tag and what it can be used for.
    That git pages existed and that you can host website through git for free.</p>

<a href="https://thecaptainfluffy.github.io/websoft/work/report/me"><h2>S02</h2></a>
<p>I've had a lot of experience with HTML, CSS and JS. However it's only been personal project and requests from family and friends. 
    I have also made a website with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL for the gaming community. I have never used frameworks or libraries, since I wasn't aware that was thing. 
    I learned all of this from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. Recently I started to learn ReactJS which is a framework for JS recently. 
    I can never get anything to look in the way I picture it in my head. HTML is the structure of how the text snippet should be represented. CSS is position and looks of the HTML structure. 
    JS is there to manipulate everything in a web document.</p>
<p>Client user interact with their browser and enter a path to get access to resource. Browser communicate between clients and server with HTTP protocol. 
    Server translate the HTTP protocol and sends back response with or without resource from web server. 
    So because of my earlier experience I can't say I learned a lot in this section. However looking forward for future work. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I have in past experienced coded with client side JavaScript. I learned this while learning ReactJS framework. I have also in my past copy paste JS without really understanding what it did.
    I'm working on a music concert advertising website with ReactJS. I relate Javascript with Java, it's very similar.
    I would also say it reminds me of Python. What I enjoy with JS is that it can manipulate everything. Which gives it a lot of control. This exercise I aimed for grade 5.
    When I worked with ReactJS I also worked with nodeJS. Which makes me really think about code once, and then implement where I want to implement the code.
    I learned that what I enjoyed most with ReactJS was NodeJS which I wasn't aware that I worked with. In ReactJS it's called components, which gives you the option to code once
    and then implement everywhere. I also learned how effiecient JS is that it can also manipulate the CSS code. I also learned the fun working with animation.

</p>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>I have worked with Node/NPM when I worked with ReactJS. This is a tool I find very powerful where you can create complete component that you can just import.
    So if you do all the HTML, CSS and JS code inside the Node component, this can then be important everywhere you want to include it. I used these tools when working
    with my music concert advertising website project, with ReacTJS. I enjoy the combination with JS and Node. I still struggle a bit with express but I start to like it as well.
    I see the usage of express and it's listen ability. I keep forgetting to read the whole assignement first and just start to code each step at the time. So I always get
    punished in the end because I need to change my code because you and me have thought differently. So this will be last assignement where I don't read whole text before coding.
    However I always solved the problem but had to redo something I already have done. I aimed for grade 5. It always takes time to do assignement 3 but is not hard.
    Assignement 4 and 5 is always tricky but doesn't take long time, which I think is a great solution.
    Today I learned what express was and how it can be used. In my music concert advertsing website I skipped it because I didn't see any use for it. However I will 
    include it in my application in the future. 
</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>My first website was made entirely with HTML, CSS and PHP. In that time I enjoyed it the best. I thought JS
    was complicated. However later years I enjoy JS more and I start to see the power using JS more.
    I feel that PHP is less interactive and interaction is to much if statement. I would say PHP is similar 
    to C and Java. I read through all the text and planned to code towards Read/Delete and organising the code
    a bit. This helped me when solving the assignement. I aimed for grade 5. I'm very satisfied with what has been done.
    But would change front end more which I will do in the future.
    Last time I worked with PHP it was through a webhost interface and I had no idea you needed XAMPP to host
    PHP. It was also nice to refresh my memory of my past experience with PHP.
    It was around 8 years ago since I worked with it last time and I started to learn prepared statement back then.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>I find popular language annoying. It's as if people don't understand when it's good or bad using
    certain language but only use it because of popularity. However I would say how ReactJS design their
    code is towards the correct way. Which is empowered with NodeJS strength. It's creating one component
    that can be imported everywhere and all the code is inside of it. I also like what Flutter introduce
    of code once and apply it everywhere. It will improve the speed of development and remove the native feelings.
    Only people who code in certain platforms get the native feeling anyway.
    However I'm not saying that these languages is the best, it's just they develop language towards the correct
    direction. Code once and apply everywhere is what made Java huge. Same goes with code one component and
    apply it everywhere.
    If I use trends.google it depends on my search term when it comes to react or reactJS. if I search for reactjs it was
    very low interest but if I searched react it's growing in size. Also it's difficult to compare with giant
    old language so you need to make fair comparison depending on the growth of search and not only total size.
    It really depends on the project. However if it was mobile application it would be Flutter and my argument would be
    it cost less to develop instead of having two teams of developers that develop same thing you only have one develop team.
    My argument of React JS for web application would be the strength of components building, which makes it
    easier to divide the project.

Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.
Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.
Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
What is your TIL for this course section?
<section>
<h2>S07</h2>
<p>.NET with ASP is a powerful tool. It is a OOP language similar to java. However compared to java it's not as good in my opinion.
    Reason is because Java can be coded once and apply on all operating systems. .NET only works on
    various Windows operating systems. .Net is in general a compiled language but with Jscript abilities from ASP.
    These tools together is powerful and was a necessary in the past to improve speed. But over time since
    scripting language have become more powerful it has been less necessary. However in back end scenario
    it's still relevent since compiled language will always be more powerful than scripting language on the
    back end side.
    I aimed for grade 4. I knew I didn't have as much time developing .NET because of other school work.
    However I attemted reading and understanding code and implement it in different scenario and manipulate.
    But after 2 days of work I realised that the code you had and the help I got on the web was different versions
    and applied it differently. Which really shows that .NET different version compatibility is bad, which made it
    a lot harder to solve certain problems. Reminds me a bit of javascript that there is 100 different ways to solve
    a certain problem, which makes it complicated to solve a problem. However in the end after redoing your whole example
    and apply a different standard I solved the problems to grade 4 which I'm very pleased with.

<p>Members: Isak Zayane, Oscar Odelstav, Simon Westerdahl and Fredrik Lémon Larsson. </p>
<p> 
The pages compared are GitLab, which is hosted on Fredrik's server, Androids Developer page, and Wikipedia.  
Overall Wikipedia has the best time on each time measure. If you compare AndroidDev and Wikipedia, which both is for documentation but AndroidDev finished 100 times slower than Wikipedia. One could argue that AndroidDev should apply a wiki instead of their layout, to get better overall speed time. The AndroidDev is also about 10 times slower on first CPU idle time, so their page will not be as quickly responsive as wikipedia either. 
We chose Fredrik’s GitLab page just to see its response time for curiosity. Since it’s hosted on a server in Fredriks garage its surprising that it finishes 10 times faster than AndroidDev. Since AndroidDev got established business servers in comparison to Fredriks server. However measuring GitLab we only measured the first login page and not further into the site. When logged in you might see slower speed since there is more security as you log in. The GitLab and Android Devs First Input Delay (FID) are 1.78  and 0.59  seconds respectively. Going above 2-3 seconds can be too long for a user to have a pleasant experience, whilst Wikipedia's FID is 0.05, which is splendid! 
An important metric in the performance section is Time to Interactive. Wikipedia, having the best time at 0.7 seconds while GitLab and AndroidDe have 8.4 and 14.5 seconds respectively. Having 14.5 seconds on TTI is not good at all and users might end up using other sources than AndroidDev while for example looking up guides for Android Studio.

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>My three security concerns are people, Bot force attacks, data collection. I had problems with people and data collection in my life. 
    people have scammed me through middle man technique, hacked my account or created bots that is attacking my website. 
    people is not perfect and is the largest security risk of all. I worked for the hospital in Oslo and they told their passwords to each other. 
    people also interact with weird links without fully comprehend what it's doing.
    Unless there is no routine or people take security serious all the time this will not be fixed. To prevent this you would have to force people to act in a certain 
    way or disconnect them completely from the routine. 
    I had my own web server and it was daily attacked by bots. I realised it all came from Russia or China, so I ended up banning all ip addresses from Russia and China since
    my product had no concerns with them. I also disabled the admin account and created 2 new accounts that would have access to enable it if it was necessary. In that way
    they could not force access my server through forcing in. There are techniques to deal with this like two-way authentication, add the text you see in the image, etc... 
    Data collection is a subject people is aware of but don't know the damage it can do in the right hands. They can find patterns in your life and because of that they can
    get your password, know exactly where you are, and where you going, know what you going to do before you actually do it. I don't mind them gather data about all of us. 
    My concerns is that they do it without letting us know what they using it for. If they had anonymous data sets that was public we could then analyze to know what
    they use the data they collected about me in their advantage and not be manipulated by them because of it.
    For example McDonalds have it incredible bright and loud in their resturaunts because it makes people eat faster. This is not something everyone knows and is aware of.
    If we knew we as a customer could tell McDonalds to stop with this because we don't want to stress to eat there but to have a calm time. But only because they manipulate
    us through science we're not aware of it makes it incredible dangerous and we only become consumers.
</p>
<p>
    My best tips to a new web programmer would be have different advanced password for each system. 
    See how larger company does with their security. Understand what is dangerous data that you're collecting and take extra measure to protect it because that is what they will want to steal.
    Create routines when a breach happens so you and your team is prepared and can act quick.
    This is where general approach and I say it with a purpose, because there will always be new techniques to breach the security but these tips will always be true.
</p>
<p>
    Today I learned that OWASP existed, which had some interesting new security problems that I wasn't aware of. I also got an insight of how incredible large all security
    problems is, and you would have an incredible interest in the field to be able to deal with all problems that exist out there.
    That the only way to deal with all of these problems is putting your trust in other people or company to solve different issues for you.

<h2>S10</h2>
<p>We first talked together as a group and divided who should do frontend work and who should do backend work. We then talked about the front stack and back stack.
    As a front stack we decided to go with React and with it's techniques like Context and Router. We considered using Redux, portals, fragments but decided it was not necessary.
    React is built up in a very similar way like a tree. I will use tree references and how it's built up to get a better understanding of React framework. 
    The roots in React tree is redux or context. Context is a technique to get global variables to multiple components without the need to pass the data between components.
    Redux is very much like Context, except Context should be used for global values that doesn't affect the compoents but is just information. 
    While Redux could affect other components. For a large project I would argue it's necessary to seperate these two but for a small project like this we decided Context was enough.
    The tree is React framework and the index.js file where everything is built and set up from. Router decide which path is necessar to access which branch.
    Branches is the pages wich adds values to the website. Inside a page more pages could exist, they can be built up as fragments. Fragments is a technique to build
    a smaller parts inside a larger page. However all these page and fragment is built up from components which is similar to the leafs.
    While the pages/fragments/branches decides where all the components/leafs should be, it's the components that put value to the website.
    Component could handle sign up and handle taking in or produce data dynamically.
    To send data from redux or context to one of the components it's best practice to do it from the index.js file and then pass it down from page > fragment > component.
    Difference between Redux and Context is that context is not visible in the code when it's passing data while Redux you have to send it between each branch since
    it could affect the branch if a state is changing.
    Portals is where the tree reference breaks. A portal can pass data from one leaf to another and ignoring the branches. This speeds up the passing of data if you have a very
    large tree.
    The back end was built up with the techniuqe AMP, which is Apache, MySQL and PHP... Fredirk talk more about this:
    I would say the project was a perfect size for two people like me and Fredrik. Fredrik is excellent when it comes backend work and I have built with react before and
    learned form my experiences. We could have just done enough and be done a lot faster but it has given us to go more indepth and use fun techniques that React has to offer
    and use them. Hardest part was how to make my own right click menu component and apply it inside another component. I will solve it in my own time, but for this project
    I decided it was not worth attempt to make. I think making a project with documentation is an excellent way to grade our competence in web development. I would like to 
    see a larger
