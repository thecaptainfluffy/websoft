<p>I have used Git, Github and Markdown in the past. Tools I really like to use.
    However Github pages is new to me and most say amazing tool that github provides to us.
    I have created and is currently working on a website. I hope that I can continue to work on it
    in this course. I am using tools like React-JS and redux to develop it.
    I have been hobby creating website last 10 years, never created somethine serious since in the past
    I have not really been structured. However after 3 years at this school I have started to developt the
    most serious project so far. Where everything is up and running on gitlab.
    Today I learned:
    Git tag and what it can be used for.
    That git pages existed and that you can host website through git for free..</p>
