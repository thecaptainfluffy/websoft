<p>I have used Git, Github and Markdown in the past. Tools I really like to use.
    However Github pages is new to me and most say amazing tool that github provides to us.
    I have created and is currently working on a website. I hope that I can continue to work on it
    in this course. I am using tools like React-JS and redux to develop it. It's a music exploration website tool. It works together with Facebook and Spotify
    I have been hobby creating website last 10 years, never created somethine serious since in the past
    I have not really been structured. However after 3 years at this school I have started to developt the
    most serious project so far. Where everything is up and running on gitlab.
    I have seen Markdown before and I'm trying to add it more to all my projects. More projects I read online, the more I see the importance of documentations.
    Today I learned:
    Git tag and what it can be used for.
    That git pages existed and that you can host website through git for free.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of experience with HTML, CSS and JS. However it's only been personal project and requests from family and friends. 
    I have also made a website with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL for the gaming community. I have never used frameworks or libraries, since I wasn't aware that was thing. 
    I learned all of this from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. Recently I started to learn ReactJS which is a framework for JS recently. 
    I can never get anything to look in the way I picture it in my head. HTML is the structure of how the text snippet should be represented. CSS is position and looks of the HTML structure. 
    JS is there to manipulate everything in a web document.</p>
<p>Client user interact with their browser and enter a path to get access to resource. Browser communicate between clients and server with HTTP protocol. 
    Server translate the HTTP protocol and sends back response with or without resource from web server. 
    So because of my earlier experience I can't say I learned a lot in this section. However looking forward for future work. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I have in past experienced coded with client side JavaScript. I learned this while learning ReactJS framework. I have also in my past copy paste JS without really understanding what it did.
    I'm working on a music concert advertising website with ReactJS. I relate Javascript with Java, it's very similar.
    I would also say it reminds me of Python. What I enjoy with JS is that it can manipulate everything. Which gives it a lot of control. This exercise I aimed for grade 5.
    When I worked with ReactJS I also worked with nodeJS. Which makes me really think about code once, and then implement where I want to implement the code.
    I learned that what I enjoyed most with ReactJS was NodeJS which I wasn't aware that I worked with. In ReactJS it's called components, which gives you the option to code once
    and then implement everywhere. I also learned how effiecient JS is that it can also manipulate the CSS code. I also learned the fun working with animation.
