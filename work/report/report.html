<p>I have used Git, Github and Markdown in the past. Tools I really like to use.
    However Github pages is new to me and most say amazing tool that github provides to us.
    I have created and is currently working on a website. I hope that I can continue to work on it
    in this course. I am using tools like React-JS and redux to develop it. It's a music exploration website tool. It works together with Facebook and Spotify
    I have been hobby creating website last 10 years, never created somethine serious since in the past
    I have not really been structured. However after 3 years at this school I have started to developt the
    most serious project so far. Where everything is up and running on gitlab.
    I have seen Markdown before and I'm trying to add it more to all my projects. More projects I read online, the more I see the importance of documentations.
    Today I learned:
    Git tag and what it can be used for.
    That git pages existed and that you can host website through git for free.</p>

<p>I've had a lot of experience with HTML, CSS and JS. However it's only been personal project and requests from family and friends. 
    I have also made a website with HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL for the gaming community. I have never used frameworks or libraries, since I wasn't aware that was thing. 
    I learned all of this from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">www.w3schools.com</a>. Recently I started to learn ReactJS which is a framework for JS recently. 
    I can never get anything to look in the way I picture it in my head. HTML is the structure of how the text snippet should be represented. CSS is position and looks of the HTML structure. 
    JS is there to manipulate everything in a web document.</p>
<p>Client user interact with their browser and enter a path to get access to resource. Browser communicate between clients and server with HTTP protocol. 
    Server translate the HTTP protocol and sends back response with or without resource from web server. 
    So because of my earlier experience I can't say I learned a lot in this section. However looking forward for future work. </p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I have in past experienced coded with client side JavaScript. I learned this while learning ReactJS framework. I have also in my past copy paste JS without really understanding what it did.
    I'm working on a music concert advertising website with ReactJS. I relate Javascript with Java, it's very similar.
    I would also say it reminds me of Python. What I enjoy with JS is that it can manipulate everything. Which gives it a lot of control. This exercise I aimed for grade 5.
    When I worked with ReactJS I also worked with nodeJS. Which makes me really think about code once, and then implement where I want to implement the code.
    I learned that what I enjoyed most with ReactJS was NodeJS which I wasn't aware that I worked with. In ReactJS it's called components, which gives you the option to code once
    and then implement everywhere. I also learned how effiecient JS is that it can also manipulate the CSS code. I also learned the fun working with animation.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>I have worked with Node/NPM when I worked with ReactJS. This is a tool I find very powerful where you can create complete component that you can just import.
    So if you do all the HTML, CSS and JS code inside the Node component, this can then be important everywhere you want to include it. I used these tools when working
    with my music concert advertising website project, with ReacTJS. I enjoy the combination with JS and Node. I still struggle a bit with express but I start to like it as well.
    I see the usage of express and it's listen ability. I keep forgetting to read the whole assignement first and just start to code each step at the time. So I always get
    punished in the end because I need to change my code because you and me have thought differently. So this will be last assignement where I don't read whole text before coding.
    However I always solved the problem but had to redo something I already have done. I aimed for grade 5. It always takes time to do assignement 3 but is not hard.
    Assignement 4 and 5 is always tricky but doesn't take long time, which I think is a great solution.
    Today I learned what express was and how it can be used. In my music concert advertsing website I skipped it because I didn't see any use for it. However I will 
    include it in my application in the future.

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>My first website was made entirely with HTML, CSS and PHP. In that time I enjoyed it the best. I thought JS
    was complicated. However later years I enjoy JS more and I start to see the power using JS more.
    I feel that PHP is less interactive and interaction is to much if statement. I would say PHP is similar 
    to C and Java. I read through all the text and planned to code towards Read/Delete and organising the code
    a bit. This helped me when solving the assignement. I aimed for grade 5. I'm very satisfied with what has been done.
    But would change front end more which I will do in the future.
    Last time I worked with PHP it was through a webhost interface and I had no idea you needed XAMPP to host
    PHP. It was also nice to refresh my memory of my past experience with PHP.
    It was around 8 years ago since I worked with it last time and I started to learn prepared statement back then.

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>I find popular language annoying. It's as if people don't understand when it's good or bad using
    certain language but only use it because of popularity. However I would say how ReactJS design their
    code is towards the correct way. Which is empowered with NodeJS strength. It's creating one component
    that can be imported everywhere and all the code is inside of it. I also like what Flutter introduce
    of code once and apply it everywhere. It will improve the speed of development and remove the native feelings.
    Only people who code in certain platforms get the native feeling anyway.
    However I'm not saying that these languages is the best, it's just they develop language towards the correct
    direction. Code once and apply everywhere is what made Java huge. Same goes with code one component and
    apply it everywhere.
    If I use trends.google it depends on my search term when it comes to react or reactJS. if I search for reactjs it was
    very low interest but if I searched react it's growing in size. Also it's difficult to compare with giant
    old language so you need to make fair comparison depending on the growth of search and not only total size.
    It really depends on the project. However if it was mobile application it would be Flutter and my argument would be
    it cost less to develop instead of having two teams of developers that develop same thing you only have one develop team.
    My argument of React JS for web application would be the strength of components building, which makes it
    easier to divide the project.
