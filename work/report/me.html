<h2>HELLO!</h2>

<p>My name is Simon Westerdahl, I'm 28 years old. I was born in Halmstad but raised in a small village called Bromölla, Skåne, 2 km from Kristianstad next to Ivösjön.</p>

<p>When I was 7 years old my best friend and his father has been a huge influence when it comes to understanding computer. However I spent more time playing computer games than actually understand the computer. However I kept playing Handball as a youth, but quitted once I grew up. I went Teknikutbildning at high school Furulundsskolan at Sölvesborg. After that I tried going into special effects withing movies and advertisment. After 1 year I ended that since that was too creative and too little computer skills. So I moved too Norway and worked as a salesmen for 1 year and then IT support towards the hospital for 4 years. During 2 of those years I hosted my first gaming server and community. I had the most popular Prophunt server on Garry's mod in whole Europe and 2nd place in the world, I also had other mods on Garry's mod, CS:GO server and Minecraft. After 2 years I decided to stop since I didn't like playing games as much anymore and I wanted to get more serious with programming</p>

<p>So this is the reason why I decided to study at Kristianstad Högskola at Datasystemsutvecklingsprogrammet. During these years I have been working on developing myself and trying to be more entrepreneur and working on sideprojects at same time as I helped out with the student union.</p>

<p>So it wasn't until I was 23 years old I got into programming, I enjoyed it at Furulundsskolan but the teacher wasn't very helpful and I didn't know how to develop further. However now I finally got into it and I love it! During my free time I enjoy Bowling and working out. I still play games sometimes, but not as much as I used to.</p>

<p>This is me, hope you have a great day!</p>
